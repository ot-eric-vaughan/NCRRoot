              </header>

              <p>Welcome to this website which offers one or more products and services. These products and services are offered at several web addresses or URLs, such as FreeScoreOnline.com, FreeScore360.com, ScoreSense.com, NationalCreditReport.com, MyCreditHealth.com, CheckMyCreditNow.com, and others. Those URLs, individually and collectively, are referred to in these Terms and Conditions as the 'Sites.' We use the terms 'you' and 'your' to include any person who accesses the Sites, obtains Materials (defined below), or purchases or acquires any product or service offered on the Sites ('product(s)' and 'service(s)' collectively referred to as the 'Services') for any amount of time. We use the terms 'we', 'us' and 'our' to refer to 2211 Partners (the 'Company'), which operates the Sites; our employees, members, officers, partners, affiliated entities, representatives, attorneys, and agents. The companies that provide the Materials or the Services to us or to you, include but are not necessarily limited to, CoreLogic Credco, LLC ("Credco"), CoreLogic Consumer Services, Inc. ("CLCS"), Equidata, Inc., and TransUnion, LLC (all such companies that provide Materials and Services to you on our behalf are referred to collectively in this Agreement as the 'Providers'). We use the term 'Materials' to mean any data or information about you that we provide to you on any web page, email, text message, instant message, or printed page, including full and partial reports and summary alerts, as full or partial fulfillment of the Services.</p>


              <p><strong>1. This is a Binding Agreement</strong></p>
              <p>These Terms and Conditions are a binding legal agreement between you and us and govern your access to the Sites and your purchase and use of the Services. PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY.</p>
              <p>Your use of the Services may also be subject to Credco's/CLCS's Terms and Conditions. <a href="http://www.corelogic.com/landing-pages/consumer-services-terms-and-conditions.aspx" target="_blank">Click here</a> for a copy of their Terms and Conditions.</p>

              <p><strong>2. Important Notice - Your Written Instructions under the Fair Credit Reporting Act</strong></p>
              <p>The Materials may include information from your personal credit profile from Experian, Equifax, TransUnion and CoreLogic Credco, LLC. You understand that by submitting your order, you are providing 'written instructions' in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended ('FCRA'), to the Providers, authorizing the Providers to obtain information from your personal credit profile from Experian, Equifax and TransUnion (collectively, the 'CRA Repositories') and provide such information to you for your own use. You also authorize the Providers to access your personal credit profile from the CRA Repositories to verify your identity and to provide you with credit monitoring, reporting and scoring products.</p>


              <p><strong>3. The Services </strong></p>
              <p>The Services consist of the products and services described on the Sites, and include but are not limited to all products and services provided on a recurring, subscription basis ("Subscription Services") or as a one-time transaction ("Transactional Services"). You acknowledge and agree that the Company obtains the Materials from the Providers. The Materials are intended to furnish you with information that you may not otherwise have readily available to you, but should not be relied upon for important personal and financial decisions. You should consult your own professional adviser for specific advice tailored to your personal situation. YOU AGREE THAT THE COMPANY AND THE PROVIDERS HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY INFORMATION (ACCURATE OR INACCURATE, COMPLETE OR INCOMPLETE) IN THE MATERIALS OR ANY REPORTS PROVIDED TO YOU AS PART OF THE SERVICES. You further acknowledge and agree that any credit scores provided to you as part of the Services are not FICO scores. Although the Services are available to consumers in all 50 states and Puerto Rico, the Services may not provide data for all locations. If you enroll in a  Subscription Service, you must ensure that it provides the information you desire for the location you desire during the applicable free trial period. If it does not, you may cancel such Subscription Service during the free trial period without charge.</p>

              <p><strong>4. How To Cancel Your Enrollment in Subscription Services</strong></p>
              <p>You may terminate your enrollment in Subscription Services at any time by calling us at the toll free number that appears on the applicable Site and on the emails that you receive from us. If for some reason you do not have access to a phone, you may terminate by writing us at 4447 North Central Expressway, Suite 110 PMB 406, Dallas, TX 75205, and requesting termination. You may not cancel via email to us. We do not provide prorated refunds.</p>

              <p><strong>5. Purchases of Transactional Services are Final</strong></p>
              <p>Transactional Services typically involve an order process associated with your request to purchase and receive a specific product and/or service, including but not limited to your credit report(s) and credit score(s) from the Providers.  We will not issue a refund to you for any Transactional Services which allow you to access your credit report(s) and/or credit score(s) following the completion of your transaction.</p>

              <p><strong>6. Our Policy Regarding Children</strong></p>
              <p>By using the Sites or purchasing or using the Services, you certify that (a) you are over 18 years of age and old enough to legally enter into a contract in your jurisdiction of residence, and (2) you have the legal capacity and authority to enter into a contract. You must be at least 18 to access or enroll in any of the Services through the Sites. The Sites are not intended for the use of children and we do not intend to collect information about children through the Sites.</p>

              <p><strong>7. In order to use the Sites and the Services, You must provide the following information:</strong></p>
              <ul style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
                <li>You must provide valid debit or credit card payment information at time of enrollment in Subscription Services, or at the time of purchase of Transactional Services. We will verify your debit or credit card information before processing your order, including performing an authorization in an amount up to the stated monthly membership fee for all Subscription Services, and/or all fees associated with the purchase of Transaction Services. The authorization amount may count against your debit or credit limit. For Subscription Services which include a free-trial period, if you do not cancel your free trial within the free trial period, you will be charged at the monthly rate in effect at that time for the Subscription Services for which you enrolled. Your debit or credit card (including, if applicable, as automatically updated by your card provider following expiration or change in account number) will continue to be charged each month at the applicable monthly rate unless and until you cancel the Subscription Services. IF THE SERVICES YOU CHOOSE INCLUDE A FREE-TRIAL PERIOD, YOUR FREE TRIAL PERIOD IS MEASURED IN 24-HOUR DAYS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU SIGN UP FOR A 7-DAY FREE TRIAL PERIOD AT 10:00 A.M. ON MARCH 1, 2010, YOUR FREE TRIAL PERIOD WILL EXPIRE AT 9:59 A.M. ON MARCH 8, 2010.</li>
                <li>You may be required to provide your social security number and other personal information, such as previous addresses, employment, and other names, so that your identity can be verified in order to use some Services.</li>
                <li>You must provide true, accurate and complete information about yourself as prompted by the applicable form(s) for the Services and, for Subscription Services, to promptly update your information if and when it changes. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, or incomplete, or we have reason to believe that such information is untrue, inaccurate, or incomplete, we reserve the right to terminate your subscription or void your transaction.</li>
              </ul>
              <br />

              <p><strong>8. Important Information regarding your authorization to charge your credit or debit card</strong></p>
              <p>BY SUBMITTING YOUR ORDER, YOU AUTHORIZE US TO CHARGE YOUR CREDIT CARD OR DEBIT YOUR BANK ACCOUNT THE STATED ENROLLMENT OR TRANSACTION AMOUNT AND/OR PROCESSING FEES AND FOR SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES ONLY, THE STATED AMOUNT PER MONTH AFTER YOUR FREE TRIAL HAS EXPIRED. Your enrollment in Subscription Services will continue month-to-month unless and until you cancel or we terminate your enrollment. If you purchase additional Services, they will be billed to the debit or credit card provided to us during enrollment.</p>

IF, NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE, LIABILITY IS IMPOSED UPON THE COMPANY OR ANY PROVIDER OR ANY CRA REPOSITORY, THEN YOU AGREE THAT THE COMPANY'S OR THE APPLICABLE PROVIDER'S OR THE APPLICABLE CRA REPOSITORIES' TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY OR ALL OF YOUR LOSSES OR INJURIES FROM THE COMPANY'S, OR THE APPLICABLE PROVIDER'S, OR THE APPLICABLE CRA REPOSITORIES' ACTS OR OMISSIONS, REGARDLESS OF THE NATURE OF THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE CLAIM, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR THE SERVICES FOR THE ONE MONTH PRIOR TO THE DATE ON WHICH YOUR CLAIM AROSE, OR U.S. $30.00, WHICHEVER IS LESS.</p>


              <p><strong>22. Applicable Law and Location of any Disputes.</strong></p>
              <p>These Terms and Conditions and all issues collateral thereto are governed by, and will be construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Texas, U.S.A., without regard to its choice of law rules, and regardless of your actual place of residence. This Agreement is to be performed in Dallas, Dallas County, Texas, and any arbitration, suit, action or other legal proceeding arising out of or related to these Terms and Conditions, the Sites, the Materials, or the Services or any issues collateral thereto must be brought in Dallas, Texas. You expressly waive any objection which you may have to the venue of any such arbitration, suit, action or proceeding in Dallas, Texas, and waive any right that you may have to assert forum non conveniens in any such arbitration, suit, action or proceeding.</p>


              <p><strong>23. ARBITRATION</strong></p>
              <p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS, DISPUTES OR CONTROVERSIES BETWEEN YOU AND US OR OUR PROVIDERS (INCLUDING OUR RESPECTIVE PARENT, AFFILIATED, SUBSIDIARY OR RELATED ENTITIES), INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO TORT AND CONTRACT CLAIMS, CLAIMS BASED UPON ANY FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL STATUTE, LAW, ORDER, ORDINANCE OR REGULATION, AND THE ISSUE OF ARBITRABILITY, SHALL BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION THAT WILL BE HELD IN DALLAS, TEXAS, PURSUANT TO THE RULES OF THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION. ANY CONTROVERSY CONCERNING WHETHER A DISPUTE IS ARBITRABLE SHALL BE DETERMINED BY THE ARBITRATOR AND NOT BY ANY COURT. JUDGMENT UPON ANY AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR MAY BE ENTERED BY ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF. THIS ARBITRATION CONTRACT IS MADE PURSUANT TO A TRANSACTION IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE AND ITS INTERPRETATION, APPLICATION, ENFORCEMENT AND PROCEEDINGS HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT ("FAA''). NEITHER YOU NOR WE SHALL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS IN ARBITRATION BY OR AGAINST OTHER CONSUMERS OR ARBITRATE ANY CLAIM AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF A CLASS OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. THE PARTIES VOLUNTARILY AND KNOWINGLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT THEY HAVE TO A JURY TRIAL.</p>
              <p>Except where expressly prohibited by law, you agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Sites or the Services or related to these Terms and Conditions, must be filed within one year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</p>


              <p><strong>24. Offers from Third Parties</strong></p>
              <p>While you are on the Sites, you may receive offers from third parties that are unrelated to the Company. You do not have to accept those offers to enroll in any of the Services or to accept the Services. However, if you do accept any third party offers, or visit any websites regarding such offers, you do so subject to the Terms and Conditions (sometimes also referred to as Terms of Use or Terms of Site) and the Privacy Policies of those sites. You acknowledge and agree that the Company has no control over, or responsibility or liability for, any offer, statement, or representation by, or any other matter connected or associated with, such third party offers or websites.</p>


              <p><strong>25. How we may contact you</strong></p>
              <p>We may communicate with and to you by e-mail sent to the email address you provided that you entered on a Site. If you have not provided an e-mail address, we may communicate with you at any e-mail or postal address that we reasonably believe is your address. You agree that all such notices and other communications that we provide to you via e-mail satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.</p>


              <p><strong>26. FCRA Disclosures</strong> </p>
              <p>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IT MAY BE A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL AND/OR STATE LAW FOR YOU TO OBTAIN A CREDIT REPORT ON ANY PERSON OTHER THAN YOURSELF, AND THAT UNDER THE FCRA, ANY PERSON WHO KNOWINGLY AND WILLFULLY OBTAINS INFORMATION ON A CONSUMER FROM A CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY UNDER FALSE PRETENSES SHALL BE FINED UNDER TITLE 18, UNITED STATES CODE, IMPRISONED FOR NOT MORE THAN 2 YEARS, OR BOTH.</p>
              <p>The FCRA allows you to obtain a copy of all of the information in your consumer credit file disclosure from consumer reporting agencies for a reasonable charge. A full disclosure of information in your file at the three national credit repositories must be obtained directly from the repositories by contacting:</p>
              <p>Experian: <a href="http://www.experian.com">www.experian.com</a><br />
                Equifax:1-800-685-1111<br />
                Trans Union:1-800-916-8800</p>
              <p>The FCRA also states that individuals are entitled to receive a disclosure directly from the consumer reporting agency free of charge under the following circumstances:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><span>You certify in writing that you are unemployed and intend to apply for employment in the 60-day period beginning on the day you make the certification;</span></li>
                <li><span>You are a recipient of public welfare assistance;</span></li>
                <li><span>You have reason to believe that your file at the consumer reporting agency contains inaccurate information due to fraud; or</span></li>
                <li><span>You have been denied credit, insurance, or employment within the past 60 days as a result of your consumer report.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p>The FCRA also permits consumers to dispute inaccurate information in their consumer report without charge. Accurate information cannot be changed. You do not have to purchase your consumer report from the Sites to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information in your credit file maintained by the CRA Repositories.</p>
              <p>The FCRA allows consumers to get one free comprehensive  disclosure of all of the information in their credit file from each of the  Repositories once every 12 months through a central source. Georgia residents  can receive two disclosures per year. Although comprehensive, the credit  reports from each of the Repositories that are available through the Sites may  not have the same information as a credit report obtained directly from the  Repositories or through the central source. To request your free annual report  under the FCRA, you must go to <a href="http://www.annualcreditreport.com/">www.annualcreditreport.com</a>,  or call 877-322-8228. Credit Reports available through the Sites are not  related to the free FCRA disclosure that you are or may be entitled to.</p>
              <p>The Credit Report you are requesting from the Company through  the Sites is not intended to constitute the disclosure of Experian, Equifax or  Trans Union information required by the FCRA or similar state laws. </p>
              <p>Consumers  residing in the states of Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey,  and Vermont may receive an additional free copy of their credit report once per  year and residents of the state of Georgia may receive two (2) additional  copies per year. For Illinois residents, credit reporting agencies are required  by law to give you a copy of your credit record upon request at no charge or  for a nominal fee </p>

              <p><strong>27. NOT A CREDIT REPAIR ORGANIZATION OR CONTRACT  </strong></p>
              <p>We may offer access to your credit report and other credit information through one or more of the Services. Neither we nor the Providers are credit repair organizations, and neither we nor the Providers are offering to sell, provide or perform any service to you for the express or implied purpose of either improving your credit record, credit history or credit rating or providing advice or assistance to you with regard to improving your credit record, credit history or credit rating. You acknowledge and agree that you are not seeking to purchase, use or access any of the credit reports, the Sites, or the Services in order to do so.</p>
              <p>Accurate adverse information in your credit report cannot be changed. If you believe that your credit report contains inaccurate, non-fraudulent information, it is your responsibility to contact the relevant Repository, and follow the appropriate procedures for notifying the Repository that you believe that your credit report contains an inaccuracy. Any information provided to you regarding the procedures followed by the various Repositories related to the removal of inaccurate, non-fraudulent information is provided without charge to you and is available for free.</p>

              <p><strong>28. Miscellaneous Terms</strong></p>
              <p>These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between you and us relating to the Sites and the Services and they supersede all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals and representations with respect to the Sites and the Services and any other subject matter covered by these Terms and Conditions. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right under or provision of these Terms and Conditions will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms and Conditions is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms and Conditions will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign these Terms and Conditions or any of your rights or obligations under the Terms and Conditions. These Terms and Conditions may be assigned by us and will inure to the benefit of our successors, assigns, and licensees. The section titles and headings in these Terms and Conditions are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. All of the Company's Providers are third party beneficiaries with respect to the provisions in these Terms and Conditions that reference them. All provisions in these Terms and Conditions that by their nature would survive termination or expiration of your access to the Sites or the Services subscription (including but not limited to those related to limits on our and our Providers' liability, your liability to us and our Providers, investigations, applicable law and venue, and our right to remove and discard your content from the Services) will survive such termination or expiration. In the event of cancelation, termination, or cessation for any reason of your membership in any of the Services, the introductory paragraph of this Agreement, sections 1-4, and 16-28 of these Terms and Conditions will survive. In the event of a conflict between any other notice, policy, disclaimer or other term contained in this website, these Terms and Conditions will control. If any provision is deemed to be unlawful or unenforceable, it will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.</p>
