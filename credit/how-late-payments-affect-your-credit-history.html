                <h1>How Late Payments Affect Your Credit History</h1>
                
              </div>

              <div class="article-text article-full-width">
                <p>Missing a payment on your credit accounts may not seem like a big deal, but it couldseverely damage your financial life.</p>

                <p>If you regularly make on-time payments, your credit score could improve over time. But if you miss a payment (or two or three), this behavior will reflect negatively on your credithistory and credit score.</p>

                <p>In fact, your payment history is one of the most important factors that goes intodetermining your credit score. In general, about one-third of your total credit score iscalculated by your history of making (or missing) payments.</p>

                <p>Simply paying bills on time—whether a credit card, student loan, cash advance or othercredit account—is the number one thing that you can do to positively impact your credithistory, says Scott Scredon, director of public relations with CredAbility, an Atlanta-basednonprofit credit counseling organization.</p>

                <p>"If you miss payments, or make several late payments in a row, that&#8217;s going to have anegative impact on your score," Scredon says.</p>

                <p>Those late payments, known in the industry as delinquencies, have a nasty habit of raisingred flags on your credit report when lenders assess your risk as a borrower. If you areviewed as a risky borrower, you might still be approved for a loan, but at a higher interestrate—meaning you&#8217;ll ultimately spend more money on your auto loan or home mortgage payments each month.</p>

                <p>While missing payments at the 30- or 60-day mark could negatively affect your creditscore, missing payments at the 90-day mark will likely have an even bigger impact,according to CredAbility, because you may be viewed as part of a higher-risk population of consumers who regularly miss payments.</p>

                <p>The good news, though, is that over time these missed payments will eventually fall offyour credit history.</p>

                <p>"If you&#8217;ve had delinquencies, the longer you&#8217;re removed from those delinquencies, themore your score is going to improve in the long term," says Larry Levine, senior mortgagebanker with A and N Mortgage Services in Chicago.</p>

                <p>Most missed payments fall off your credit history after about seven years, but bankruptciesstay on your credit history for about 10 years, according to the Federal Trade Commission.</p>

                But, of course, the best way to avoid missing a payment—and suffering a long-term blemishon your credit history—is to make a sensible budget and to stick to it."</p>

                <p>There really aren&#8217;t any silver bullets out there, but there are a few ways to get thingsunder control," Scredon says. "There is a big advantage and a big benefit for someone whocan pay all their bills on time, month after month."</p>

                <p>If you are trying to get a handle on your finances, a good first step is to order a copy ofyour credit report. Federal law entitles you to one free credit report per year from each ofthe three national credit reporting agencies. You can order your free credit reports onlinethrough annualcreditreport.com. Be sure to check for any errors and get those corrected assoon as possible because they could impact your credit score too.</p>
