                <h1>Do My Check-Writing Habits Affect My Credit?</h1>

              <div class="article-text article-full-width">
                <p>To have a clean credit score, you&#8217;ll want to be careful with your checking account</p>

                <p>Most banking activities are not reported to the three national credit reporting agencies, so they will not appear on a credit report. Generally speaking, making deposits or withdrawals, writing checks, closing accounts and having multiple accounts are all credit-neutral.</p>

                <p>Because check writing is related to neither credit nor debt, checking account information will not appear on your credit report, says Judy Sorensen, president of the Association of Credit Counseling Professionals.</p>

                <p>But there are two key ways in which bad banking behavior could negatively affect your credit score.</p>

                <p><strong>Bouncing checks and account overdrafts</strong></p>

                <p>Simply having overdraft protection associated with your checking account could affect your credit history, although this will depend on the bank or credit union. The overdraft protection could show up as a line of credit and as a revolving account on your credit report. Not having it fully paid off could have an impact on your credit score.</p>

                <p>If you fail to pay the associated fees over an extended period of time, you could end up in more serious trouble.</p>

                <p>First, Sorensen says, the bank could turn the amount of your overdraft or fees associated with the bounced checks over to a collection agency, effectively transforming your overdraft into a debt, which will turn up on your credit report.</p>

                <p>Second, the bank could sue you for the overdraft amount and associated fees. If the bank wins, the civil judgment is a debt owed to the court, Sorensen says.</p>

                <p>Either of these events—the opening of a collections file or a civil case resulting in a judgment against you—could have serious implications for your credit score.</p>

                <p>By regularly monitoring your account balance, you can avoid overdraft and bounced-check fees, as well as their potential impact on your credit score.</p> 

                <p><strong>&#8216;Hard&#8217; inquiries</strong></p>

                <p>You may be aware that an application for a new line of credit could affect your credit score, but financial inquiries not related to credit could have an effect as well. When you open a new account at a bank or credit union, the institution may decide to review your credit report.</p>

                <p>A &#8220;soft&#8221; inquiry, which occurs when the credit inquiry is not being reviewed by a potential lender, won&#8217;t ding your account. &#8220;Hard&#8221; might.</p> 

                <p>A &#8220;hard inquiry,&#8221; which is interpreted as a sign that you need to take on additional debt, could knock between zero and five points off of your credit score. This may not seem like much, but if you open several accounts in quick succession, the small numbers could add up to big ones. If a bank or credit union pulls your credit report before you open a new account, it will generally count as a hard inquiry.</p>

                <p>Another problem spot to be aware of are reports issued by the organization ChexSystems. This is a debit bureau that gathers information from banks about checks bounced for insufficient funds.</p>

                <p>&#8220;While checking account information doesn&#8217;t appear in a credit report,&#8221; Sorensen says, &#8220;it can still affect a consumer&#8217;s ability to conduct financial transactions.&#8221;</p>

                <p>The ChexSystems report could be looked at when you apply for bank services or even some loans, such as mortgages, she says.</p>

                <p>Ultimately, your bank accounts are a small piece of the credit pie, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you can neglect them. This is another reminder that just because a financial transaction isn&#8217;t directly related to credit or debt, it doesn&#8217;t mean it won&#8217;t pop up on your credit report down the road.</p>
