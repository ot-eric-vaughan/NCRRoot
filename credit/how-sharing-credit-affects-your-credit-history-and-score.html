                <h1>How Sharing Credit Affects Your Credit History And Score</h1>
                
              </div>

              <div class="article-text article-full-width">
                <p>The same rule about thinking twice before sharing personal information, such as your Social Security number, applies when you're asked to share your credit.</p> 

                <p>While your credit report is yours and yours alone—the credit reporting agencies keep credit files for individual consumers, not spouses or families—sharing credit with someone can have a major impact on your own credit history and credit score.</p>

                <p>If you co-sign a loan, open a joint account or add an authorized user to a credit card, for example, the account information could appear on both parties&#8217; credit reports.</p>

                <p>So before you decide to share credit, like with a spouse or child, it&#8217;s important that you first consider how a shared account could impact your own finances and creditworthiness.</p>

                <p><strong>Co-signing a loan</strong></p>

                <p>When applying for a loan, the lender will generally assess the applicant&#8217;s collateral, creditworthiness and capability to pay, says Brian Frederick, a certified financial planner with Stillwater Financial Partners in Scottsdale, Ariz.</p>

                <p>If the lender decides the applicant is too great of a risk based on a least one of these measures, though, a co-signer with an established credit history may be required in order to secure the loan, Frederick says. If a college student, for example, is taking out his or her first loan in order to purchase a car, a parent might need to co-sign the loan for it to be approved by the lender.</p>

                <p>If you decide to co-sign a loan for someone, the lender is required to give you a cosigner&#8217;s notice, which will detail all of your obligations, according to the Federal Trade Commission. If the borrower defaults on the loan, you may have to pay up to the full amount of the debt, and any late fees or collection costs could tack on more to your bill.</p>

                <p>&#8220;My counsel is: Don&#8217;t co-sign unless you would be ok with taking over the loan yourself,&#8221; Frederick suggests.</p>

                <p>If you co-sign a loan, the loan&#8217;s information will typically be reported on your own credit report, as well as the primary borrower&#8217;s. So if the primary borrower is unable to make payments on time, the late payment history may show up on your credit report, which could reflect negatively on your credit history and score.</p>

                <p>If you co-sign a loan, you may also have trouble getting other credit, according to the FTC, because creditors will view the co-signed loan as one of your obligations.</p>

                <p><strong>Opening a joint account</strong></p>

                <p>If you have a spouse or partner, you may consider opening a joint account for a mortgage, credit card, installment loan or other type of personal loan.</p> 

                <p>If you and your partner are shopping around for a mortgage, for example, a joint account would allow you both to use your earning power and credit history to qualify for the loan.</p>

                <p>While joint accounts may be convenient, it&#8217;s important to note that with any type of joint account, the credit activity is reported on both parties&#8217; credit reports. This means that any negative behavior on a joint account, such as late payments, could reflect negatively on the credit history and credit score of both individuals listed on the account.</p>

                <p>In the case of divorce, an agreement with a lender even trumps a divorce decree, Frederick says. If debt from a joint account is assigned to your ex-spouse in a divorce, the creditor can still come after both parties.</p>

                <p>&#8220;You can either pay the creditor money in exchange for a release (make sure to get this in writing) or pay the bill and sue your ex-spouse for breaching the divorce decree,&#8221; Frederick says.</p>

                <p>If you live in one of the nine community property states—Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington or Wisconsin—any debt racked up during a marriage is considered to be a debt of both spouses, even if the debt is not from a joint account.</p>

                <p><strong>Adding an authorized user to an existing account</strong></p>

                <p>If you add an authorized user to one of your existing accounts—typically a credit card account—that person can use your available credit, but you will still be responsible for making all payments. Parents often add their children to an account as authorized users when they are not able to qualify for their own credit, Frederick says.</p>

                <p>But before you authorize someone to use your credit, make sure you are prepared to pay down any debt that the authorized user acquires, and consider how your own credit behavior may affect the authorized user&#8217;s credit history.</p>

                <p>If you are the primary cardholder, your account behavior could be reported on the authorized user&#8217;s credit report. If you pay the account as agreed and on time, your payment behavior could reflect positively on the authorized user&#8217;s credit history and score. On the other hand, if you miss payments and have other negative activity on the account, the authorized user&#8217;s credit history and score could be negatively impacted as a result.</p>
