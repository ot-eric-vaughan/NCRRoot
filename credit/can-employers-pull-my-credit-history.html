                <h1>Can Employers Pull My Credit History?</h1>
                
              </div>

              <div class="article-text article-full-width">
                <p>When job hunting, you expect potential employers to comb through your previous work experience in order to assess your skill sets and to determine whether you are a good fit for the job.</p>

                <p>But in addition to studying your résumé and cover letter, employers are also legally permitted to pull a copy of your credit report.</p>

                <p>Your credit report contains your borrowing history. Different types of organizations—such as lenders, credit card companies, insurance companies and landlords—use the information in your credit file to help assess your risk as a consumer.</p>

                <p>According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which protects the accuracy and privacy of information held in the files of credit reporting companies, a potential employer is allowed to pull a copy of your credit report, provided that you first give them written consent.</p>

                <p>Not quite 50 percent of organizations perform credit background checks on job candidates, according to a 2012 survey conducted by the Society for Human Resource Management.</p>

                <p>Of these organizations, only 13 percent reported running credit checks on all job candidates, while 34 percent said they did credit checks only for certain positions, such as for senior executives, and positions that require financial responsibility or access to confidential employee information, for example.</p>

                <p>If a potential employer asks for your permission to pull a copy of your credit report, the organization is likely interested in how you manage and pay off debt. If the company requests your credit report, they are given a modified version that shows this kind of information.</p>

                <p>While some potential employers might run a credit check as part of the hiring process, current employers are also allowed to pull your credit report if they are considering you for a promotion, reassignment or retention, according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).</p>

                <p>If you are in the midst of a job search, it$#8217;s important that you understand your rights as a job applicant. If you have an employer who asks for permission to pull your report, it is equally important to know the rules employers must follow in order to stay in compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act.</p>

                <p>As you go through the interview process or apply for a promotion, consider these three guidelines employers must abide by when pulling your credit report:

                  <ol>
                    <li><b>Employers must first get your written permission before accessing your credit report.</b> If applying for a job, your written consent will generally be requested in a document that is separate from your application, according to the FTC.</li>

                    <li><b>If an employer plans to turn down your application, terminate your employment or give you a reassignment based on information in your credit report, you must first receive a copy of the report.</b> The employer is also required to give you a document that spells out your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. All of this must be done before any adverse action is taken.</li>

                    <li><b>An employer must tell you if an adverse action, such as being denied employment, is being taken because of information in your credit report.</b> The employer$#8217;s notice must include the name, address and phone number of the company that provided the credit report, and you have the right to contact that company to dispute the accuracy of the information. You are also entitled to a free credit report from the company that reported the information, if you request it within 60 days.</li>
                  </ol>
                </p>

                <p>You may want to monitor your credit report before applying for a new job to ensure all of the information is accurate and up to date in case an employer requests to see it. You can access one free credit report each year from each of the three national credit reporting agencies through annualcreditreport.com.</p> 

                <p>Many states have their own consumer reporting laws, and some states have enacted legislation that limits the use of credit reports when employers are making hiring decisions. If a potential employer or your current employer asks to pull your credit report, consider checking with your state$#8217;s laws.</p>
