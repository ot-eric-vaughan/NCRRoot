                <p>Your credit report is established the moment you open a credit account, such as a loan or credit card. If you&#8217;ve never borrowed money due to choice or circumstance, a visit to annualcreditreport.com to receive a free copy of your credit report may reveal that you don’t have a credit history.</p>
