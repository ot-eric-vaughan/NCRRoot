                <h1>Why Don't I Have A Credit History When I Check at AnnualCreditReport.com?</h1>
                
              </div>

              <div class="article-text article-full-width">
                <p>Your credit report is established the moment you open a credit account, such as a loan or credit card. If you&#8217;ve never borrowed money due to choice or circumstance, a visit toannualcreditreport.com to receive a free copy of your credit report may reveal that you don&#8217;t have a credit history.</p>

                <p>Even if you&#8217;ve established some credit in the past, a &#8220;thin file&#8221; indicates a lean track record as a credit consumer.</p>

                In today&#8217;s credit-oriented world, those with a thin or non-existent credit history could be missing out on the benefits of a powerful financial tool.</p>

                <p>&#8220;A good credit record is necessary to get a rental home, postpaid wireless phone service,auto and homeowners insurance, some employment opportunities and sometimes even alibrary card,&#8221; says Linda Sherry, director of national priorities at Consumer Action.</p>

                <p>Establishing credit requires patience, sound judgment and the determination to pay your debts on time.</p>

                <p>If annualcreditreport.com shows that you are without a credit history, consider these fourtips to help you establish and maintain good credit:</p>

                <p><strong>1. Start small.</strong></p>

                <p>Good credit is determined, in part, by how reliably you pay your debts. While openingseveral lines of credit at once may seem like a quick way to initially build your credit history, doing so could actually land you in a worse situation. Even consumers with anestablished credit history may see a drop in their credit score if they have too many credit accounts, or open too many new accounts within a short period of time.</p>

                <p>&#8220;The good news is [you] can start by borrowing small amounts and paying it back on time,&#8221; says Scott Scredon, director of public relations at CredAbility. &#8220;This will help [you] gradually build a credit history and qualify for larger loans.&#8221;</p>

                <p><strong>2. Obtain a secured credit card.</strong></p>

                <p>The most common type of credit card is unsecured, meaning it is not secured by collateral. A secured credit card, on the other hand, holds the money in your checking or savingsaccount as collateral. Secured credit cards, which look just like regular credit cards, can be obtained through your bank or a credit union.</p>

                <p>Consumer Action recommends saving $300 to $500 to apply for a secured card, whichgrants you an equal line of credit. Your limit may not be as high as it would be on a typicalcredit card, but it&#8217;s a safe place to start. &#8220;If you use the account wisely, you will build a credit history,&#8221; Sherry says.</p>

                <p>For your secured credit card to appear on your credit report, you&#8217;ll need to make sure thefinancial institution reports the card activity to the three national credit reporting agencies.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Become an authorized user.</strong></p>

                <p>A trusted friend or family member may grant you &#8220;authorized user&#8221; status on his or her existing credit card account. Unlike joint account holders, authorized users are not liable topay off any debt on the card.</p>

                <p>Ideally, the person who owns the account pays the bill on time, and you spend within anagreed-upon limit. This positive payment activity will then be recorded in both your and the primary cardholder&#8217;s credit reports, making it a win-win situation.</p>

                <p>This arrangement can be risky, though, if the primary cardholder misses paymentsâ€”activity which can also end up on your credit report. So use discretion when being added to an account as an authorized user, and find out from the lender in advance if you canremove yourself from an account.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Report alternative credit.</strong></p>

                <p>Some lenders will report alternative credit, such as rent and utility bills, which can helpconsumers with no credit history or a thin file to build and establish their creditworthiness.</p>

                <p>If your credit application is rejected by a potential lender, ask if he or she has a way toauthorize you based on alternative credit.</p>

                <p>You may also consider finding a lender from a financial institution where you&#8217;ve already established a relationship.</p>

                <p>&#8220;If there is already a pattern of positive banking history, a lender may be more willing toconsider alternative credit sources,&#8221; says Maricarmen Smith-Martinez, a financial educatorat CredAbility.</p>

                <p>Once you&#8217;ve taken steps to establish your credit, check back at annualcreditreport.com topull a copy of your credit report. You can receive one free credit report from each of thethree national credit reporting agencies each year, and you can obtain your credit score fora small fee.</p>
