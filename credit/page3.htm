                <p>While your credit report is yours and yours alone—the credit reporting agencies keep credit files for individual consumers, not spouses or families—sharing credit with someone can have a major impact on your own credit history and credit score.</p>

                <p>When job hunting, you expect potential employers to comb through your previous work experience in order to assess your skill sets and to determine whether you are a good fit for the job. But in addition to studying your résumé and cover letter, employers are also legally permitted to pull a copy of your credit report. </p>
