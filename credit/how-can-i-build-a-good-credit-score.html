                <h1>How Can I Build A Good Credit Score?</h1>
                
              </div>

              <div class="article-text article-full-width">
                <p>A good credit score is vital to showing financial responsibility. Lenders, insurers and even potential employers may obtain credit reports to decide whether you&#8217;re a valid candidate for a loan, an insurance policy or a job.</p>

                <p>If you lack good credit, or any credit at all, you can&#8217;t change your credit score over night, but there are six ways to gradually improve it over time.</p>

                <p><b>1. Pay your bills on time.</b> Paying bills late or having an unpaid account referred to a collection agency can negatively reflect on your credit score, according to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the country&#8217;s federal banking authority. To ensure your bills are paid on time, you can set up automatic payments from a bank account or set calendar reminders to pay bills by their due dates.</p>

                <p><b>2. Get a credit card.</b> Having a major credit card can benefit your credit score, especially if you pay it on time and keep balances low.</p>

                <p>&#8220;In order to ensure that a new credit line is beneficial, consumers should charge only what they can pay back in cash, &#8221; says Howard Dvorkin, founder of Consolidated Credit Counseling Services.</p>

                <p>The difficulty can lie in getting a credit card in the first place, since being approved for one usually relies, in part, on your credit score. If a major credit card is out of the question, Dvorkin suggests trying to get a credit card at a department store that you frequent. Department store credit cards are easier to get, but carefully read the fine print associated with the credit line before opening one.</p>

                <p>&#8220;Department store cards are great for rewards, but be careful because they typically have a lower credit limit, so making a big purchase will take a toll on a person&#8217;s credit utilization, &#8221; Dvorkin says. Credit utilization, or how much of your available credit is being used, accounts for about 35 percent of your overall credit score, Dvorkin says.</p> 

                <p>Another alternative is getting a secured credit card, which is a credit line that allows you to put money in a deposit account with an issuer, and then the credit line is tied to that deposit. A $250 deposit, for example, usually means a $250 credit limit.</p>

                <p>&#8220;You can only spend what you have, which is great for people who are rebuilding their credit, &#8221; Dvorkin says.</p>

                <p><b>3. Have a mix of credit references.</b> Many credit-scoring models take into account the number and types of credit accounts you hold. A mix of loans and credit cards may improve your score, according to the Federal Reserve.</p> 

                <p>Any kind of loan that&#8217;s reported to the three national credit reporting agencies can be used to build or repair credit. This can include car loans, student loans, mortgages and other types of bank loans.</p>

                <p><b>4. Keep the ratio of debt to available credit as low as possible.</b> If the amount of money you owe on credit is close to your credit limits, it will likely have a negative effect on your score, according to the Federal Reserve.</p> 

                <p>If you do have credit cards and are using a significant portion of your available credit, consider paying those down.</p> 

                <p>&#8220;A lower [debt to credit] ratio is good for your credit score, so people who are using a significant portion of their available funds should try to pay for everyday items like groceries and shopping in cash, &#8221; Dvorkin recommends.</p>

                <p><b>5. Keep your credit cards to build a longer credit history.</b> Having open accounts for a long time can be beneficial to your credit score.</p>

                <p>If you do close an account, it could affect your credit utilization and reflect negatively on your credit score.</p>

                <p>&#8220;Whenever you close an account, you lower the combined credit limit on your cards, which could make it seem like you&#8217;re close to maxing out your available credit, &#8221; Dvorkin says.</p>

                <p><b>6. Check your credit report periodically for potential errors.</b> In a recent Federal Trade Commission study, about one in five consumers had errors on their credit reports, and one in four had errors that could negatively affect their credit scores.</p>

                <p>To be sure there aren&#8217;t errors, regularly monitor your credit report. You are entitled to one free credit report from each of the three national credit reporting agencies each year, and you can order your free reports online through annualcreditreport.com. If you do find an error, work with the credit reporting agencies to fix it.</p>
