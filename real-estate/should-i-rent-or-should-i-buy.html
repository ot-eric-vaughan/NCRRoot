                <p>Buying a home&#8212;the largest purchase most people will ever make&#8212;is the &#8220;American Dream.&#8221;</p>

                <p>&#8220;Real estate is often an excellent investment, perhaps the number one source of wealth-building for families,&#8221; according to an online Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation guide for young consumers. &#8220;Owning your own home also can be a great source of pride and stability.&#8221;</p>

                <p>But home ownership isn&#8217;t for everyone.</p>

                <p>&#8220;There are some trends taking place in American society regarding the redefinition of the &#8216;American Dream,&#8217;&#8221; says Bill Deegan, CEO of Renter Nation, a group that advocates for renting. &#8220;Success is not measured by whether you own a cozy little house in the suburbs.&#8221;</p>
              
              <p>Consider these five tips when deciding whether renting or buying is right for you:</p>
              
              <p><strong>1. Check your credit score.</strong></p>
              <p>Whether you want to rent or buy, knowing your credit score is important, says Brian Sullivan, a spokesman for the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).</p> 
              
                <p>&#8220;Your credit profile will drive everything. So if you can repair a blemished credit record before you start the home-buying process, that&#8217;s good,&#8221; Sullivan says. &#8220;You don&#8217;t want to find out when you&#8217;re about to apply for a mortgage that you have a bad credit score.&#8221;</p>
              
              <p>In the same respect, Sullivan says, landlords also look at credit history when deciding whether to offer a lease.</p> 
              
                <p>&#8220;The Fair Housing Act protects your housing rights. But if you have awful credit and you&#8217;ve demonstrated an inability to make timely rent payments or mortgage payments in the past, then somebody can turn you down, definitely,&#8221; he says.</p> 
              
              <p>You can obtain one free copy of your credit report once a year from each of the three national credit reporting agencies by going to www.annualcreditreport.com. You can obtain your credit score more than once a year for a small fee.</p>
              
              <p><strong>2. Decide what kind of financial commitment you want to make.</strong></p>
                <p>A 2013 MacArthur Foundation survey found that the nation&#8217;s economic uncertainty has made home buying less appealing to some people. The financial commitment of buying a home can be overwhelming, Deegan says.</p>
              
                <p>&#8220;To tie up a huge amount of capital might not make the best sense in the world,&#8221; he says.</p>
              
                <p>But homeownership is a great way to build equity, says Alice Kuder, a Realtor with Prudential Northwest Realty in Seattle. Instead of paying landlords each month, homeowners, while paying interest to a bank, are putting money into something they&#8217;ll get back if they decide to sell.</p>
              
                <p>&#8220;Buying a house is a savings account, really,&#8221; Kuder says. &#8220;Historically, the value, even if it goes down, it eventually comes back up.&#8221;</p>
              
              <p><strong>3. Know whether you can afford home repairs.</strong></p>
              <p>According to a 2013 study by Trulia, buying a home is, over an average of years, significantly cheaper per month than renting in many markets.</p>
              
                <p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ve got the down payment part, your monthly payments from a house are going to be often less than your payments for rent will be,&#8221; Kuder says. &#8220;But the big challenge for everybody is coming up with the down payment. But now there are so many loans that are only 3 percent interest that it&#8217;s not as big a deal [to come up with the money].&#8221;</p>
              
                <p>But this doesn&#8217;t take into consideration the amount of money renters save by not paying for home repairs, Deegan argues.</p>
              
                <p>&#8220;The advocates for people to buy a home never mention that you&#8217;re going to have to keep the roof solid, you&#8217;re going to have to do all the internal appliances and things like that,&#8221; Deegan says. &#8220;It costs a lot to maintain a home.&#8221;</p>
              
              <p><strong>4. Decide whether you want to stay in the same area for a long time.</strong></p>
              <p>A home purchase can be a great investment, but usually not in the short-term, Kuder says. Generally, the longer you stay in a home, the more equity you build.</p>
              
              <p>Renting, on the other hand, offers the flexibility to move around and change neighborhoods, cities or even countries without having to sell a home, Deegan says.</p>
              
              <p><strong>5. Find a housing counselor to help talk you through the process.</strong></p>
                <p>&#8220;There are hundreds of agencies around the country supported by HUD where you can find these counselors,&#8221; Sullivan says.</p>
             
                <p>Housing counselors may charge a nominal fee, but they&#8217;ll talk you through the decision-making process and help you choose whether renting or buying is right for you.</p>
              
                <p>Whether to rent or buy, Sullivan says, &#8220;is a highly personal decision.&#8221;</p>
