              </div>

              <div class="article-text article-full-width">
                <p>When you&#8217;re buying a home, you may be thinking about neighborhoods, space and school districts, but what you really want to know about is price. You want to know just how much you&#8217;ll have to shell out for your piece of the American Dream.</p>

                <p>&#8220;Rent versus buy is not as simple a comparison as it might seem,&#8221; says Steve Cook, managing editor of the real estate news website Real Estate Economy Watch and former vice president of public affairs for the National Association of Realtors. &#8220;Don&#8217;t just compare what you pay in rent with the prospective cost of a mortgage.&#8221;</p>

                <p>Before you buy, take steps to figure out how much you can afford to spend on a home so that you don&#8217;t end up in over your head.</p>

                <p><strong>Step 1: Take stock of your financial situation.</strong> You won&#8217;t know what you can afford to spend on a home until you break down your monthly expenses. To get a sense of how much money you spend every month, gather your last few monthly bank statements and review each one.</p>

                <p>Divide your monthly expenditures by category, including rent, utilities (like gas, electric and water), insurance, loans, credit card payments, transportation and groceries. Don&#8217;t forget smaller expenses, such as dry cleaning and dining out—these $5 and $10 purchases add up, especially when you&#8217;re trying to afford a home.</p>

                <p>Once you have a sense of what you&#8217;re spending, you&#8217;ll have a better idea of where you can cut back in order to save a few bucks each month.</p>

                <p>While your income may increase in the future, focus on what your finances look like today. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t make sense to buy a home to fit tomorrow&#8217;s needs on today&#8217;s income,&#8221; Cook advises. &#8220;Stay within your budget, and you&#8217;ll be able to build up equity as your family grows.&#8221;</p>

                <p><strong>Step 2: Understand your debt-to-income ratio.</strong> Quite simply, your debt-to-income ratio  is the amount of debt you carry versus your income. Lenders have determined that you can generally afford to spend between 28 and 36 percent of your gross (pretax) income on paying your debts, including mortgage payments, car loan payments, child support and alimony, credit card bills, student loans, insurance and real estate taxes.</p>  

                <p>If a mortgage on the home of your dreams would put you over the ideal debt-to-income ratio, a lender may not qualify you for a mortgage.</p>

                <p><strong>Step 3: Figure out how much you can (realistically) afford.</strong> How much you can afford to spend on a mortgage depends on your other expenses, such as taxes, insurance and any additional outstanding debts.</p>

                <p>In general, experts agree that you can spend between 25 and 33 percent of your gross monthly income on housing expenses, though the exact amount you spend depends on your own comfort level. When creating your housing budget, note any savings you&#8217;re trying to build, and keep in mind you will likely still want to do a little discretionary spending (like going out with friends, for example).</p>

                <p>&#8220;Guard against real estate agents or lenders who may try to &#8216;sell you up&#8217; to buy a home that is at or above your budgeted amount,&#8221; Cook warns. &#8220;Remember, they make more money if you spend more on a house. No matter how wonderful a home that is beyond your means may seem, you will always be happier in a home you can afford.&#8221;</p>

                <p>Don&#8217;t forget to factor in the down payment, which can be up to 20 percent of the purchase price of the home. The interest rate that you are offered may also determine what you can afford.</p>

                <p><strong>Step 4: Calculate the true amount of homeownership.</strong> Owning a home is about more than just the mortgage payments. You also need to account for other expenses—such as general maintenance, assessments and taxes—that can quickly add up.</p>

                <p>Consider having your home inspected before purchase to avoid any unforeseen costs. &#8220;Mold, asbestos, lead paint, termites and radon are hidden threats to you and your house. They can ruin your health and your pocketbook,&#8221; Cook says.</p>

                <p>There are other hidden costs to consider , too. For example, if you purchase a home in a neighborhood located 20 miles from work, you&#8217;ll need to factor in the costs associated with commuting. Or, if the home of your dreams has an enormous yard, you&#8217;ll need to account for the maintenance costs, including landscaping and regular watering.</p>

                <p>Buying a home is exciting, but it should be done thoughtfully. By understanding what you can truly afford, you can purchase your dream home without breaking the bank.</p>
