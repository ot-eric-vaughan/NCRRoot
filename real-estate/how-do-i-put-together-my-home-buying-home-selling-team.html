              <div class="article-text article-full-width">
                <p>Whether buying or selling a home, the team you choose to represent you can make or break the deal. Surrounding yourself with experienced professionals can help make the process easier, while choosing the wrong team—or no team at all—can leave you with a major headache.</p>
                <p>Buying or selling a home is &#8220;a financial transaction that you need to take seriously,&#8221; says Lauren Sigman, a certified financial planner in Denver who has spent more than 30 years in the real estate business. &#8220;You need to pay attention to the details.&#8221;</p>

                <p>Here are some tips to keep in mind when selecting your real estate team:</p>

                <p><strong>1. Start with a real estate agent.</strong></p>

                <p>Good real estate professionals are worth their weight in gold, Sigman says. When buying or selling a home, the first step is to find a licensed real estate agent. You can start by asking friends and neighbors if they have recommendations. As you find agents you like, ask them for their license numbers. Most jurisdictions throughout the United States require agents to hold licenses, and you can check their record to see if they&#8217;ve had any complaints filed against them.</p>

                <p>In addition, check to see if your potential real estate agent is a member of the National Association of Realtors. The organization, which includes more than one million members, has a strict code of ethics.</p>

                <p>Next, ask about their proficiencies: Do they have expertise in the type of home you want to buy or sell (condo, two-flat, detached house, etc.)? Do they know the neighborhood well? If you&#8217;re selling, what marketing will they do for you?</p>

                <p>Finally, understand your agent&#8217;s role. Does the agent represent the buyer, the seller, or both parties?</p>

                <p><strong>2. Find a good lender.</strong></p>

                <p>Whether you&#8217;re buying your first home or selling in order to buy a new property, your lender is an integral part of your real estate team.</p>

                <p>Hiring an experienced mortgage broker can help you understand the amount and type of loan you can qualify for. The mortgage broker will assess your creditworthiness and help find an appraiser to assess the value of the property you are interested in buying. Then, the mortgage broker will shop around for you, trying to find the best loan.</p>

                <p>&#8220;Getting a loan requires an extraordinary amount of paperwork and detail,&#8221; Sigman says. &#8220;You want a mortgage broker who is experienced and detail-oriented.&#8221;</p>

                <p>You may also want to consider other types of lenders, including big national lenders, regional or local banks and credit unions.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Enlist the help of your real estate agent when assembling the rest of the team.</strong></p>

                <p>The Rolodex of a real estate agent can become one of your best weapons, Sigman says, saving you time, effort and energy. It can also help you build the rest of your real estate team, which may include the following:</p>

                <p><em>Appraiser:</em> If you&#8217;re buying a home, the appraiser&#8217;s opinion of the home&#8217;s value is a big factor in whether a lender gives you a loan . Make sure your appraiser is accepted by the lender and has some experience appraising similar properties, Sigman says. Also, check to see if the appraiser is choosing the most relevant, comparable sales, which will help give you an idea of what buyers are actually paying.</p>

                <p><em>Home inspector:</em> As a buyer, getting a home inspection is important. An inspection can reveal hidden, costly problems you may not have noticed. Preferably, your home inspector will have inspected other homes in the neighborhood.</p>

                <p>You may want to see if your chosen home inspector belongs to the American Society of Home Inspectors. To join that group, inspectors must complete at least 250 home inspections that meet or exceed the group&#8217;s standards of practice.</p>

                <p><em>Attorney:</em> Both buyers and sellers may feel more at ease if they have an attorney on their team, though many states don&#8217;t require an attorney be present at closing. You may want to consider adding one to your team if you are purchasing or selling a complex, expensive or troubled property, but a real estate attorney can also help you with more traditional real estate transactions.</p>

                <p><em>Insurance agent:</em> When it comes to finding an insurance agent, Sigman suggests going with the insurance company that insured your previous home. If you&#8217;re a first-time buyer, your auto insurance provider may be able to give you a bundled deal if you purchase your homeowners insurance through them.</p>

                <p>Mortgage lenders typically require you to have homeowners insurance. If you don&#8217;t purchase insurance, they will for you, which could leave you with high premiums and limited coverage. Working with a reliable insurance agent will help make sure you get the best (and safest) bang for your buck.</p>

                <p><em>Title officer:</em> A title officer searches the title for any issues that could impact the sale of the property. A point of potential savings for buyers, Sigman says, is the title policy. See who the title agency was for the previous owner. If the seller&#8217;s title policy is less than 10 years old, there&#8217;s a chance you can purchase the policy at a reissue rate.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Trust but verify.</strong></p>

                <p>Assembling a good team is important when you buy or sell a home. Ultimately, though, the responsibility rests with you. Pick good professionals, Sigman says. Verify what they&#8217;re saying is true and read all of your documents before signing on the line.</p>
