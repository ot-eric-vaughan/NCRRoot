                <h1>How Are Mortgage Rates Tied To Credit?</h1>
                
              </div>

              <div class="article-text article-full-width">
                <p>Many people dream of homeownership. But the best deals, in the form of the lowest mortgage rates, often go to the borrowers with the highest credit scores.</p>

                <p>Credit scores are determined by agencies that compare your credit report to those of other consumers. The higher your score&#8212;generally on a scale from 300 to 850&#8212;the more likely lenders will view you as a borrower who can pay your bills on time.</p>

                <p>Credit scores above 700 or 720 are generally the ones considered most desirable by lenders, which usually means a lower mortgage rate&#8212;or the interest charged on a mortgage.</p>  

                <p>&#8220;If you have a credit score below 680, it starts to get tougher, and your options are significantly reduced,&#8221; says Greg McBride, a senior financial analyst with Bankrate.com.</p>

                <p>It&#8217;s hard to give a one-size-fits-all statement on what kind of mortgage rates these &#8220;subprime&#8221; borrowers might expect to see, since there are many factors involved in determining mortgage rates. But it&#8217;s generally the case that consumers with lower credit scores will borrow at a much higher mortgage rate, which will mean paying an &#8220;astronomical&#8221; amount more over the life of a loan, McBride says.</p>

                <p><strong>What are the options for consumers with lower credit scores?</strong></p>

                <p>One option is a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan. These loans are appealing to many first-time homebuyers who have thin credit files or can&#8217;t make a large down payment. FHA loans only require a 3.5 percent down payment, and that money can be gifted from someone else, like a parent. The FHA guarantees the loan, making it less of a risk for lenders to offer you a mortgage.</p>

                <p>Mortgage rates will still be higher than those of non-FHA, prime borrowers, though. And if you take out an FHA loan, you&#8217;ll be required to pay private mortgage insurance premiums, which could mean forking over hundreds of dollars more per month.</p>

                <p>Credit isn&#8217;t the only factor that comes into play when a broker is determining your mortgage rate&#8212;proof of income and down payment are also big factors. Would-be homeowners with lower credit scores can help boost their appeal to lenders by offering a larger down payment.</p>

                <p>&#8220;It takes a lot of risk off the back of the lender. You&#8217;re less likely to default, and that might be enough to tip the scales in your favor,&#8221; McBride says.</p>

                <p>McBride says he doesn&#8217;t recommend people whose credit scores are lower than 700 to purchase a home&#8212;at least not yet.</p>

                <p>If you are unable to qualify for a good mortgage rate now, you may want to consider holding off on your home purchase. Raising your credit score and socking away money for a larger down payment could help you receive a better mortgage rate and a lower monthly payment down the road.</p>

                <p>&#8220;Take your time. Put yourself in a situation to get the best rate available, which translates into more buying power,&#8221; McBride says.</p>
