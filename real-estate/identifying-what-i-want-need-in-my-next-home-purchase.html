                <h1>Identifying What I Want/Need In My Next Home Purchase</h1>
                
              </div>

              <div class="article-text article-full-width">
                <p>A house is an important investment and one of the largest purchases most people will ever make.</p>

                <p>Before buying a home, potential buyers need to consider exactly what they want&#8212;and, more importantly, what they need&#8212;in their next home purchase.</p>

                <p>Alice Kuder, a Realtor for Prudential Northwest Realty in Seattle, suggests that homebuyers should start with their bigger, broader needs and then get into more specific wants from there.</p>

                <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important to go from what they think they must have, to what they prefer, to what they don&#8217;t care for or don&#8217;t care about,&#8221; Kuder says.</p>

                <p>If you are trying to decide which factors to prioritize in your next home purchase, consider these seven steps:</p>

                <p><strong>1. Decide where you want to live.</strong> Consider what type of location would work best for you and your family. Do you want to stay in your current town? Do you want a place in the heart of the city? Would you prefer a quiet neighborhood with good schools?</p>

                <p><strong>2. Know what you can afford.</strong> According to the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development&#8217;s (HUD) website, no more than about one-third of your income should be spent on housing. The website offers a mortgage calculator that allows you to see how much you can afford to pay per month.</p>

                <p>When calculating your housing expenses, don&#8217;t forget to consider factors like utility costs and home upkeep.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Decide what type of housing you want.</strong> Single family? Multifamily? A condo? The kind of living space you need will depend, in part, on your family situation, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>

                <p>Lori Fischer, creative director of Rethink Home Interiors, helps sellers make their homes appealing to potential buyers. Fischer says it&#8217;s important for buyers to focus on &#8220;flow of space,&#8221; or how they think they are going to live in a particular space, before making a purchase.</p>

                <p>Along with deciding on the type of housing they prefer, buyers should also consider the number of bedrooms and bathrooms they need, Kuder says.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Decide what condition you want your potential home to be in when you purchase it.</strong> Some buyers want a fixer-upper; others want nothing to do with home repair, Kuder says.</p>

                <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important to know how much work they want to do,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Do they only want to do cosmetics? Do they want to move walls around? Does it need to be in move-in condition?&#8221;</p>

                <p><strong>5. Make a wish list.</strong> Assess what you like and dislike about where you currently live, Kuder suggests.</p>

                <p>&#8220;Sometimes we&#8217;re so used to [the current home] that you don&#8217;t even realize what spaces you&#8217;re using more than others,&#8221; she says.</p>

                <p>HUD offers a printable homebuyer&#8217;s checklist to help buyers &#8220;get the juices flowing&#8221; as they decide what they want in a their new space, says HUD spokesman Brian Sullivan. That list includes factors like how much renovation you&#8217;d be willing to do, how close to public transportation you&#8217;d like to be and what style of house appeals to you most.</p>

                <p>&#8220;A lot of these things [on the checklist] are no-brainers, you&#8217;d think, but if you&#8217;ve never bought a home before, you may not be thinking about all these things,&#8221; he says.</p>

                <p><strong>6. Prioritize.</strong> Not everything on your wish list will be absolutely necessary, Kuder says. For example, many buyers think they need bathtubs, she says, but in reality, &#8220;you ask when they last took a bath and they won&#8217;t even be able to remember.&#8221;</p>

                <p>The same goes for large yards and garage space, she says.</p>

                <p>Use your checklist to help you separate the needs from the wants.</p>

                <p><strong>7. Be prepared to change your mind.</strong> &#8220;It&#8217;s important to allow for evolutions as [prospective homebuyers] go looking because what they think they need in the beginning and &#8216;must have&#8217; often will change as they go around and start looking at things,&#8221; Kuder says.</p>

                <p>It&#8217;s OK to update your wish list as you go, she says, because you&#8217;ll probably be living in your new home for a while.</p>

                <p>&#8220;I put resale value way down on the bottom of a priority list,&#8221; Kuder says, &#8220;because what&#8217;s important is you, right now, and how much you&#8217;re going to enjoy your space.&#8221;</p>
