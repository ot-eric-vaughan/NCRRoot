                <h1>What Is A Mortgage?</h1>

              <div class="article-text article-full-width">
                <p>A mortgage is a loan to finance the purchase of a home&#8212;usually the largest single purchase a person will make in his or her lifetime.</p>
                
                <p>When you take out a mortgage, you are required to pay back the debt, with interest, over a certain period of time, though the length of time and terms of loans vary. Your home serves as collateral for your loan, which means if you fail to pay off the debt, the lender can take the property.</p>
                
                <p>Your monthly mortgage payment will consist of both principal and interest, sometimes with closing costs rolled in, says Frank Donnelly, a certified financial planner and chairman of the Mortgage Bankers Association of Metropolitan Washington (DC).</p>
                
                <p>Principal is the sum of money you borrow in order to buy your home, and it is usually equal to the purchase price of the home minus a down payment, which is the amount of cash you pay upfront.</p>
                
                <p>Interest is what a lender charges you to use the money you borrowed and is expressed as a percentage&#8212;or interest rate.</p>
                
                <p>Closing costs can include commissions and fees for lawyers, real estate agents, mortgage brokers, inspectors and appraisers, as well as paperwork and tax fees. The amount is finalized when the home sale is completed at closing.</p>
                
                <p><strong>What are the common types of mortgages?</strong></p>
                
                <p>The three most common types of mortgages are fixed rate, adjustable rate and interest-only.</p>

                <p>With a <strong>fixed-rate mortgage (FRM),</strong> the interest rate stays the same over the entire term of the mortgage, meaning you know upfront exactly how much you will pay over the life of the loan. The amount you pay each month never changes.</p>

                <p>Usually, loans won&#8217;t be shorter than 10 years, &#8220;and it&#8217;s pretty difficult to find anything longer than 30,&#8221; Donnelly says.</p>

                <p>Most lenders will give loans in five-year increments, but 15- and 30-year FRMs are the most common of these. In fact, the 30-year FRM is the most common loan of all types.</p>

                <p><strong>Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs)</strong> generally offer a lower initial interest rate than fixed-rate loans by as much as 1 percent, but rates fluctuate over the life of the loan. When interest rates rise or fall, so will your monthly mortgage payments.</p>

                <p>Interest rates change depending upon a set schedule, such as every year or every five years, which you determine with your mortgage lender when you take out the loan. There are also hybrid ARMs, which are typically printed as 5/1 ARM. For these loans, there is a fixed rate for the first five years, and then the interest rate adjusts every year after that.</p>

                <p>On both FRMs and ARMs, each payment consists of both interest and principal, though not in equal parts. At first, you will pay much more interest than principal.</p>

                <p>&#8220;The process, it&#8217;s [usually] very gradual,&#8221; Donnelly says. &#8220;Every month you&#8217;re chipping away more and more of the principal. So the next payment, more goes to the principal again because you&#8217;re paying more of the balance.&#8221;</p>

                <p>Finally, an <strong>interest-only loan</strong> is the rarest of these three options. For these loans, homeowners pay only interest each month, allowing them to have low monthly payments at first. However, these payments rise as principal is added to the mix, typically on a fixed schedule determined with the lender.</p>

                <p>If you select an interest-only loan, you are not putting any money into the principal and therefore aren&#8217;t putting any equity in your home. This means that the bank owns a much larger portion of your home for much longer than if you were to go with a more traditional mortgage.</p>

                <p><strong>How do you know what kind of mortgage loan is right for you?</strong></p> 

                <p>By using an online mortgage calculator, you can compare different mortgage terms and determine how much you&#8217;ll have to pay each month, depending upon which type of mortgage you want. Talk to a mortgage banker or broker to discuss different types of mortgages and which is best for your situation.</p>

                <p>&#8220;Get the right loan for you,&#8221; Donnelly says. &#8220;That&#8217;s critical.&#8221;</p>

                <p>Before speaking to a lender about applying for a mortgage, know your credit score, how much of a down payment you&#8217;re comfortable making, what monthly payment is within your budget and how long you plan to stay in the home, Donnelly says.</p>

                <p>And if you already know what type of loan you think is best for you, that&#8217;s a bonus, he says.</p>
