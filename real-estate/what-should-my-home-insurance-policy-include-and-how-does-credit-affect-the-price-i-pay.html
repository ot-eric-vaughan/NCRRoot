                <h1>What Should My Home Insurance Policy Include And How Does Credit Affect The Price I Pay?</h1>
                
              </div>

              <div class="article-text article-full-width">
                <p>Owning a home can be rewarding. But when disaster strikes, you need to be sure that you&#8217;re properly covered, and your credit history could affect the price you pay for that protection.</p>

                <p>According to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), homeowners insurance is needed for two main reasons: to protect your assets and to satisfy your mortgage lender. Your home is likely one of your largest assets&#8212;if not your largest&#8212;and most mortgage lenders require that you have an adequate home insurance policy.</p>

                <p>Policies vary from state to state. Homeowners should be aware of what&#8217;s covered&#8212;and, more importantly, what&#8217;s not&#8212;under their insurance policy, and how much they can expect to pay under that policy, says Bill Davis, a regional representative for the Insurance Information Institute, a group that provides information for consumers to improve the public&#8217;s understanding of insurance.</p>

                <p>&#8220;Everything depends on the type of policy,&#8221; Davis says.</p>

                <p><strong>1. Be sure the basics are covered.</strong> Most homeowners insurance policies cover the structure of your home, personal belongings, liability for bodily or property damage caused to other people on your property and additional living expenses if anything happens to your home that makes you have to live away from it, Davis says.</p>

                <p>&#8220;There are some deluxe policies that you can get that have other things and other coverages, but those are the standard homeowner policy coverages,&#8221; he says.</p>

                <p>To be reimbursed for damage to your home, a &#8220;covered peril&#8221;&#8212;meaning a fire or windstorm, for example&#8212;must be to blame for the damage, according to the NAIC.</p> 

                <p>But what exactly is covered depends on the type of basic policy you&#8217;ve purchased. Some policies may cover damage from fire, theft or falling trees, while others cover burst pipes and household appliance failure.</p>

                <p>&#8220;Of course, you&#8217;re going to pay more for the additional coverages, but they are available,&#8221; Davis says.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Know what&#8217;s not covered.</strong> Basic homeowners insurance policies don&#8217;t cover flood damage, according to the NAIC.</p>

                <p>Depending on where you live, you may qualify for flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program or through a national insurer, according to the NAIC. If your home is in a flood plain, your mortgage lender will probably require you to buy flood insurance.</p>

                <p>Damage from earthquakes also isn&#8217;t covered under standard policies, Davis says.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Make sure you&#8217;re covered for the area in which you live.</strong> California is known to have earthquakes regularly, Davis says, so having earthquake coverage in addition to your basic homeowners policy is essential there.</p>

                <p>Flood insurance is a little trickier, Davis says, since &#8220;you can get a flood anywhere.&#8221; The National Flood Insurance Program is administered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency and can be useful to those whose homes flood most often. But flood insurance through private carriers is a smart additional coverage for many homeowners, he says.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Understand insurance scoring and how your premiums are determined.</strong> In addition to how much coverage you need, insurance companies often use insurance scoring, based on your credit history, to help set your rates, Davis says. A good credit score could help you secure a better insurance premium.</p>

                <p>Insurance companies sometimes use credit scores, along with other factors, to help predict how likely you are to file an insurance claim and the amount of the claim, according to the Federal Trade Commission.</p>

                <p>Check your credit score to find out if it may negatively affect your insurance rates, Davis suggests. Whether&#8212;or how much&#8212;your credit score will be factored in during insurance scoring depends on the state in which you live, since states set the regulations for insurance companies, Davis says.</p>

                <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just one of many factors used in setting rates. A lot of people think this is a primary determinant&#8212;it&#8217;s not,&#8221; Davis says.</p>

                <p>According to the NAIC, insurers determine premiums, in part, based on the characteristics of your home, such as the cost to rebuild it, how old it is and the claims history of the home.</p>

                <p>But the choices and characteristics of the homeowner are also considered, according to the NAIC. The length of time you&#8217;ve been with your insurance carrier and your history of filing claims, for example, can be factored in when determining your premiums.</p>
