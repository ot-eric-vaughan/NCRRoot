                <h1>How To Shop Around For A Mortgage</h1>
                
              </div>

              <div class="article-text article-full-width">
                <p>Buying a home is the biggest purchase you&#8217;ll ever make. While it&#8217;s exciting, it can also be overwhelming, particularly if you&#8217;re a first-time homebuyer.</p>

                <p>When it&#8217;s time to buy, finding the right mortgage may be the most important step. Shopping around, comparing costs and negotiating the terms for the perfect mortgage could save you thousands of dollars, according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).</p>

                <p>To make a daunting process&#8212;filled with many documents, fees, and interest rates and other numbers that may not make a whole lot of sense&#8212;run as smoothly as possible, consider these eight steps when shopping around for a mortgage:</p>

                <p><strong>1.  Don&#8217;t start looking for a house just yet.</strong></p>

                <p>Homebuyers often search for the home of their dreams before even starting the mortgage application process. But shopping for a house before thinking about financing will only set you up for unrealistic expectations and disappointment, says Donald J. Frommeyer, president of the National Association of Mortgage Professionals.</p>

                <p>&#8220;You need to get approved [for a mortgage] first and find out what you can afford,&#8221; he says.</p>

                <p><strong>2.  Prepare your documents.</strong></p>

                <p>In recent years, especially after the recession, applying for a mortgage has become more complicated and labor-intensive.</p>

                <p>&#8220;Everything needs to be documented,&#8221; Frommeyer says. &#8220;When you say something, you have to be able to prove it.&#8221;</p>

                <p>Before you apply for your mortgage, you will need to get all of your documents that relate to your finances and assets in order. These include: W-2 forms from the past two years, paycheck stubs, 401(k) statements, the last two months of checking and savings account statements, any proof of supplemental income, documents on long-term debts&#8212;such as car and student loans&#8212;and tax returns.</p>

                <p><strong>3.  Review all documents the lender gives you.</strong></p>

                <p>A lender will provide you with important documents either during or shortly after the application process. Unless your mortgage application has been denied, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recommends that you take special note of the following four documents:

                <ul>
                  <li><em>Good Faith Estimate (GFE) Disclosure:</em> This three-page form will include your total loan amount, your basic loan terms (how long you'll be paying for the loan) and your initial monthly payments.</li>
                  <li><em>Truth in Lending Disclosure:</em> This statement will include your annual percentage rate (APR) and the total amount you will have paid after you have made all your scheduled mortgage payments.</li>
                  <li><em>Mortgage Servicing Disclosure:</em> This document will tell you whether the lender can sell the servicing rights of its loans. If so, you may have to deal with a different servicer once you begin making payments.</li>
                  <li><em>Settlement Cost Booklet:</em> This booklet includes information on the various stages of the home-buying process.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p><strong>4.  Go to various lenders.</strong></p>

                <p>Remember that you&#8217;re shopping around, so go to multiple lenders and collect the documents that outline your potential mortgage costs and rates.</p>

                <p>You can get a loan from several types of lenders. These include big commercial banks, mortgage companies, credit unions, savings banks and loan associations. You can also use a mortgage broker, who will then find a lender for you.</p>

                <p><strong>5.  Use a mortgage shopping worksheet.</strong></p>

                <p>Once you&#8217;ve obtained cost information from several lenders, use a mortgage shopping worksheet and online mortgage calculator. These tools allow you to do a side-by-side comparison of your estimated monthly mortgage payments for each loan program and lender.</p>

                <p><strong>6.  Negotiate for the best deal.</strong></p>

                <p>Once you&#8217;ve chosen your lender, negotiate for a better deal. According to the FTC, lenders may offer different prices for the same loan terms to people with similar qualifications. There&#8217;s no need to be shy or embarrassed when asking lenders or brokers if they can give you a better mortgage deal or match those you have found elsewhere.</p>

                <p><strong>7.  Lock in your rate.</strong></p>

                <p>Once you&#8217;ve chosen the right mortgage for you, consider asking the lender for a written lock-in on the terms agreed upon. Although you may be charged a fee for locking in a loan rate, the lock-in can protect you from rate increases while your loan is being processed, according to the FTC. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that if rates fall, you&#8217;ll remain at the higher rate.</p>

                <p><strong>8.  Go find your home.</strong></p>

                <p>Once you have been approved for your mortgage, the fun part can begin: finding the perfect home that&#8217;s within your budget.</p>
